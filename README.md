Internship Initial Assignment

Welcome to Soham's Work from Home Internships.

This is an initial qualifying module. This has to be developed by each group individually. You will have to complete this module within 10-15 days from date of allotment.

Upload all the code on your github repository regulary so that we can track your progress. After completion of this small module, we will evaluate your coding standards and development level. We will assign a bigger project module with higher complexity and more functionalities.
